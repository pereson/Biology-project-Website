    <h1>Welcome — Pacific Ocean coral-reef ecosystem</h1>
    <p>This project examines how resource changes, overfishing, plastic pollution, and warming affect a coral-reef ecosystem. Below are four subsections focusing on <strong>Lemon Shark</strong>, <strong>Parrotfish</strong>, <strong>Coral Reefs</strong>, and the <strong>Carbon cycle</strong>.</p>

    <!-- LEMON SHARK -->
    <section id="lemon" class="card section-card">
      <h2>Lemon Shark</h2>

      <h3>Population</h3>
      <p>
        Overfishing is the primary threat to lemon sharks; they are frequently caught both intentionally and as bycatch in longline and gillnet fisheries. Throughout much of their range these fisheries are intense and often poorly managed. As a result, lemon sharks have experienced severe population declines, currently estimated at about <strong>50–79% over the past 50 years</strong>.
        Habitat loss and degradation (for example, mangrove removal for coastal development and shrimp aquaculture) are additional major threats.
      </p>

      <h3>Resource availability</h3>
      <p>
        Lemon sharks feed on parrotfish and other reef fishes, so their food resources can be substantial where prey are abundant. In locations where parrotfish populations have increased, lemon sharks may temporarily benefit from more available prey. However, because lemon sharks have slow life histories and face heavy fishing pressure, increased prey alone has not reversed population declines.
      </p>

      <h3>Limiting factors</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Intense commercial and recreational fishing (targeted fishing and bycatch).</li>
        <li>Illegal and unregulated harvesting for fins and meat.</li>
        <li>Habitat loss (mangrove removal, coastal development) reducing nursery areas.</li>
        <li>Global warming and climate-related habitat changes that indirectly reduce prey availability.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- PARROTFISH -->
    <section id="parrot" class="card section-card">
      <h2>Parrotfish</h2>

      <h3>Population</h3>
      <p>
        Parrotfish are herbivores that graze algae on coral reefs. When reefs are bleached and algae accumulate, parrotfish populations can increase because more food is available. Parrotfish and coral reefs are linked in a feedback loop: healthy parrotfish grazing helps maintain coral by removing algae, and healthy coral provides habitat and recruitment sites for juvenile reef fish.
      </p>

      <figure class="figure">
        <img src="parrot fish copy.png" alt="Parrotfish graph placeholder" class="figure-img">
      </figure>

      <p>
        In surveyed areas where coral reefs were bleached, parrotfish abundance was observed to be approximately <strong>8 times higher</strong> than in non-damaged areas, and individuals were on average <strong>~20% larger</strong>. These multiple forms of data (counts and size) show a short-term carrying capacity increase for parrotfish where algae blooms occur.
      </p>

      <h3>Resource availability</h3>
      <p>
        Coral bleaching leaves bare substrate and allows fast-growing algae to accumulate. That algae becomes a food resource for parrotfish and can support larger numbers and faster growth in the short term. Parrotfish grazing in turn helps limit algal dominance and can aid coral recovery if bleaching is not recurring too frequently.
      </p>

      <h3>Limiting factors</h3>
      <p>Overfishing is the main limiting factor for parrotfish: commercial and subsistence fisheries in the Pacific remove individuals and prevent populations from expanding further, despite increased food availability in bleached areas.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- CORAL -->
    <section id="coral" class="card section-card">
      <h2>Coral Reefs</h2>

      <h3>Population</h3>
      <p>
        Coral reefs form complex habitats that support reef biodiversity. Coral cover and reef health are part of a feedback network with parrotfish and other reef species. When parrotfish grazing is sufficient, algae are kept low and coral juveniles can settle and grow; conversely, when coral declines (for example from bleaching), habitat complexity is lost and the ecosystem shifts toward algal dominance.
      </p>

        <img src="coralbleaching.png" alt="Coral reef graph placeholder" class="figure-img">
      </figure>

      <h3>Resource availability</h3>
      <p>
        Parrotfish reduce fast-growing algae, which supports coral recruitment and survival. Thus resource availability for corals (clean substrate and adequate light) is mediated by grazers such as parrotfish; this creates the feedback loop where both groups influence each other's carrying capacity.
      </p>

      <h3>Limiting factors</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Coral bleaching caused by ocean warming.</li>
        <li>Ocean acidification and pollution (nutrients, plastics).</li>
        <li>Overfishing and destructive fishing gear that remove key grazers or damage reef structure.</li>
      </ul>

    <!-- CARBON -->
    <section id="carbon" class="card section-card">
      <h2>Carbon cycle — role in the ocean</h2>
      <p>
        Surface waters exchange gases with the atmosphere, absorbing and releasing carbon dioxide and other gases. Marine phytoplankton convert CO₂ into organic matter via photosynthesis; that organic carbon flows through the food web to consumers and decomposers. When organisms die, their bodies may sink to deeper waters where carbon is either remineralized (returned to dissolved forms) or buried in sediments where it can be sequestered for centuries.
